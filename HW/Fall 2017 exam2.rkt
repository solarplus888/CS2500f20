Problem 1 [INCOMPLETE: Don't know how to use predicate as argument in functions]
Design the function take-while, that takes a list and a predicate, and returns all the elements from the front of the list for which the predicate returns true: that
is, all the elements up until the first element that does not pass the predicate. Do not
use any list abstractions to implement this function, including length. And, be sure to
give the best signature you can for this function.
|#

;take-while: [List-Of X] Boolean -> [List-Of X]
(check-expect (take-while (list 2 4 5)5)(list 2 4))
(check-expect (take-while (list 2 4 5)0)(list 2 4 5))
(check-expect (take-while (list 2 4 5)2)empty)

(define (take-while x y)
  (cond
    [(empty? x)x]
    [(cons? x)(if (not (equal? (first x) y))
                  (cons (first x)(take-while (rest x) y))
                  empty)]))

Problem 2
Design a function counts-of-multiples, that takes a list of Naturals and a
Natural, and produces a Count of how many numbers in the given list are a multiple
of the given number and how many numbers in the list are not. For instance, if the
given number is 2, then counts-of-multiples returns the number of even numbers
and number of odd numbers in the list. Reminder: (modulo m n) returns the remainder when m is divided by n.

Use local and list abstractions (figures 95 and 96 from the book, which are reproduced
at the end of the exam) to design this function
